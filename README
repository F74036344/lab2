use following command to update the program lab2_BMI:
	make
(The makefile methods were written in the file "Makefile" in the directory "lab2", the same I placed my .cpp, .o and ./files )
Use following command to execute lab2_BMI:
	./lab2_BMI
The values in file.in are the same as ones of the example.
